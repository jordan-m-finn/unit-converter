# Unit Converter

A simple, clean unit converter web application that converts between metric and imperial measurements. This project demonstrates fundamental JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design principles.

## Features

- Converts between common measurement units:
  - Length (Meters ↔ Feet)
  - Volume (Liters ↔ Gallons)
  - Mass (Kilograms ↔ Pounds)
- Real-time conversion as you input numbers
- Clean, modern user interface
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

- Inter font family

## How It Works

The application features a simple interface where users can:
1. Input a number in the main field
2. Click the "Convert" button
3. View conversions for all three measurement types simultaneously

Conversion rates used:
- 1 meter = 3.281 feet
- 1 liter = 0.264 gallon
- 1 kilogram = 2.204 pounds
